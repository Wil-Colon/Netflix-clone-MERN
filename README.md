# Built with
-JS -Node/Express -React -Context API -HTML -Sass -JWT

# Why was application created?
The application was created as a tutortial from Youtuber Lama Dev. The application helped with further understanding of Context API use and Sass. Practice makes perfect, the project was a great course to help utilize MERN stack and learn in the process. I further challenged myself to add methods of allowing the admin to select/remove movies off the created genre playlists. As a further challenge, I've also utilized a custom carousel and attempted to create the movies selection hover to appear more like Netflix.
